# Live Video Streaming Application - System Design

This repository contains the high-level system design for a live video streaming application. The goal of this design is to provide a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly platform for live video broadcasting, viewing, and interaction.

## Features

### Functional Requirements
- **Live Video Streaming**: Stream live video from broadcasters to viewers.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure sign-up, login, and access control.
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive chat feature during live streams.
- **Stream Recording and Playback**: Record live streams and provide playback options.
- **Notifications**: Alert users about live and upcoming streams.
- **User Profiles and Subscriptions**: Manage user profiles and allow users to subscribe to broadcasters.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent viewers.
- **Low Latency**: Ensure minimal delay in video streaming.
- **High Availability**: Provide uninterrupted service.
- **Security**: Protect user data and secure video streams.
- **Quality of Service**: Maintain high video quality with adaptive bitrate streaming.

## Architecture Components

### Client-Side
- **User Interface (UI)**: Web and mobile applications for streaming and viewing.
- **Media Capture**: Capture video and audio from the broadcaster's device.
- **Media Player**: Play live streams for viewers.

### Server-Side
- **Authentication Server**: Handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Streaming Server**: Manage live stream ingestion and broadcasting.
- **Chat Server**: Enable real-time chat during live streams.
- **Notification Server**: Send notifications to users.
- **Database**: Store user data, stream metadata, and chat logs.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute video streams globally.
- **Storage**: Store recorded streams and user data.

## Detailed Design

### Client-Side
- **Web/Mobile App**:
  - Built using frameworks like React Native for mobile and React.js or Angular for web.
  - Incorporates libraries like WebRTC for live video capture and playback.

### Server-Side
- **Authentication Server**:
  - Built using frameworks like Django or Express.js.
  - Utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data.

- **Streaming Server**:
  - Uses protocols like RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) for video ingestion.
  - Transcodes the stream using FFmpeg or a similar tool to multiple bitrates for adaptive streaming.
  - Utilizes HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) for video delivery.

- **Chat Server**:
  - Uses WebSocket for real-time communication.
  - Frameworks like Socket.IO or SignalR can be used.

- **Notification Server**:
  - Uses services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).

- **Database**:
  - User and stream metadata stored in PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
  - Chat logs stored in a fast-access database like Redis.

- **CDN**:
  - Services like AWS CloudFront, Akamai, or Cloudflare.

- **Storage**:
  - Services like AWS S3 for storing recorded streams.

## Flow of Data

1. **Stream Initiation**:
   - The streamer starts a live session using the client app, which captures the video and audio.
   - The video stream is sent to the Streaming Server via RTMP.

2. **Stream Processing**:
   - The Streaming Server transcodes the video into multiple bitrates.
   - The video segments are stored temporarily and delivered using HLS/DASH.

3. **Content Delivery**:
   - The CDN caches and delivers the video segments to viewers with minimal latency.
   - Viewers access the stream via the Media Player in the client app.

4. **Real-Time Interaction**:
   - Viewers interact via the Chat Server using WebSockets.
   - Messages are sent and received in real-time.

5. **Notifications**:
   - The Notification Server sends alerts to users about live streams and updates.

6. **Recording and Playback**:
   - The Streaming Server records the live session.
   - Recorded streams are stored in cloud storage and made available for on-demand playback.

## Scalability and Reliability

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of running instances based on the current load.
- **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple instances of each server component across different geographic regions to ensure high availability.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to monitor system health and log errors for troubleshooting.

## Security

- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure and standard authentication.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and in transit.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Native, Angular, WebRTC
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django, Express.js, FFmpeg
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare
- **Storage**: AWS S3
- **Messaging**: WebSocket, Socket.IO, SignalR
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **Notifications**: FCM, APNS

## Conclusion

This system design provides a comprehensive overview of the key components and architecture needed for a live video streaming application. The focus on scalability, reliability, security, and real-time interaction ensures a robust and user-friendly experience.
